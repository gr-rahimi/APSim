# APSim

APSim is an automata compiler using python. It supports many essential automata compiling features such as minimization, fan in/out constraint, connected components extraction,... etc.
APSim uses NetworkX as its underlying data straucture to maintain the automataon as a graph and run automaton processing algorithms to reshape the underlying graph.
